# Climate-Change_Analysis
This project involves analyzing global land temperature records to understand temperature trends and seasonal patterns. The goal is to provide insights into climate data using time series analysis and visualization techniques.  

Project Components:

Data Preprocessing:
Load and clean the climate data, including renaming columns for clarity.
Handle missing temperature values by filling them with the mean temperature.

Time Series Decomposition:
Perform seasonal decomposition to extract trends, seasonal patterns, and residuals.

Visualization:
Visualize temperature trends and seasonal patterns using line and bar plots.
